## What is QuantCoder FS?

**QuantCoder FS** is a full-stack AI-powered research platform designed to accelerate and automate key workflows in quantitative finance. It coordinates LLM agents across a modular architecture, enabling:

- PDF Summarization – extract structured insights from academic or financial documents  
- Fundamental Data Analysis – parse and interpret financial fundamentals  
- Algorithmic Strategy Generation – turn insights into QuantConnect-ready trading code  
- Article Search – find and rank academic or industry papers relevant to your query

Built with a **FastAPI + CrewAI** backend and a **Next.js** frontend, the platform offers a seamless interface for exploratory research, strategy development, and structured analysis.

> *Both backend and frontend are currently private during active development.*  
> The [legacy CLI prototype](https://github.com/SL-Mar/quantcoder-legacy) remains publicly available.
