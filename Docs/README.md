# <div align="center">QuantCoderFS R&D</div>

QuantCoderFS R&D is an independent quantitative research initiative, powered by LLM and custom automation.\
The platform currently powers two specialized applications:

---

<div align="center"><strong>Focus</strong>: Equity Research Assistant<br><strong>License</strong>: Open Source, Local-First</div>

Chat with Fundamentals generates AI-powered executive summaries based on real-time financial data.\
It simplifies fundamental analysis and equity research workflows.

**Key Features:**

- Executive summaries from financial metrics, news, and historical prices
- Monte Carlo simulation, Value at Risk (VaR) estimation
- Single-ticker and comparative multi-ticker analysis
- Fully local-first and user-owned API key setup
- Built with CrewAI, LangChain, FastAPI, and EODHD APIs

---

<div align="center"><strong>Focus</strong>: Strategy Research and Automation<br><strong>License</strong>: Under review</div>

QuantCoderFS is designed for quant developers who want to automate the full research-to-code workflow.

**Key Features:**

- Search and summarization of academic papers, earnings calls, and financial media
- Executive insight extraction from structured and unstructured sources
- Automated QuantConnect strategy code generation (Python)
- Modular CrewAI architecture

> *This repository documents the architecture, components, and development of the platform.*\
> The [legacy CLI prototype](https://github.com/SL-Mar/quantcoder-legacy) remains available for users awaiting the FS version.
