## What is QuantCoderFS?

**QuantCoderFS** is a local-first, modular AI platform for automating **alpha research** in quantitative finance. It orchestrates LLM agents, financial data APIs, and reproducible workflows to support:

- **Search & Retrieval** ‚Äì academic papers, earnings transcripts, and financial media  
- **Summarization** ‚Äì context-aware insight extraction from structured/unstructured documents  
- **Fundamental Analysis** ‚Äì LLM-assisted interpretation of equities data  
- **Strategy Code Generation** ‚Äì Python output compatible with the **QuantConnect** platform  

The platform is powered by a **FastAPI + CrewAI** backend and a **Next.js** frontend.  
All workflows are designed to run locally ‚Äî no login, no tracking, no cloud dependency.

> _This repository documents the architecture, components, and development of the platform._  
> The [legacy CLI prototype](https://github.com/SL-Mar/quantcoder-legacy) remains available for early contributors.
